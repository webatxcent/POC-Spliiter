# POC-Splitter

This is a Proof of Concept (POC) to demonstrate the ability to create two linked scrolling regions using the SplitterContainer.
The objectives are:

TL;DR Create a more extensible property sheet control 

1. have two panels separated by a splitter bar so that the horizontal content area of each can be adjusted.
2. content in the left panel will contain captions, content in the right panel will contain value data. 
3. allow the content to extend beyond the visible area of the panels
4. use the auto-scroll feature of a panel to allow the right panel to be adjusted using inherent functionalty
5. synchronize the content of the left panel with the right so that they remain in alignment when the right is scrolled.
